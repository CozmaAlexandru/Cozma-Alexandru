## 🧩 Projects Included

- **FACTORS INFLUENCING TOLERANCE TOWARDS IMMIGRANTS: A DATA ANALYSIS IN R AND PYTHON** — This project explores techniques for data processing, analysis, and
visualization using the R and Python programming languages. Fundamental
statistical methods were applied, relevant visualizations were created, and
insights were extracted from the analyzed datasets.

- **HR DASHBOARD IN TABLEAU** — Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard offering a comprehensive
view of HR KPIs. The project involved building dynamic visualizations,
implementing intuitive navigation elements, and designing flexible filters.
One of the main challenges was effectively organizing a large number of
charts within a single dashboard while maintaining clarity and usability

- **SALARY CLASSIFICATION USING DECISION TREES IN R** — Developed predictive models to classify salary levels using
socio-demographic variables from the 1976 Current Population Survey.
Performed comprehensive data preprocessing, including feature
engineering, discretization of continuous variables, correlation analysis,
and Cramer’s V–based feature selection, along with converting dummy
variables into categorical features. Implemented and compared three
decision tree algorithms in R, utilizing packages such as ggplot2, rpart,
caret, and CHAID.

- **SALES DATA WAREHOUSE WITH POSTGRESQL** — Designed and implemented a scalable data warehouse using a
medallion architecture to integrate customer, sales, and order datasets.
Developed end-to-end ETL pipelines for data extraction, cleaning,
transformation, and aggregation across all layers, and modeled the
warehouse using a star schema. Incorporated data quality checks and
validation rules throughout the process.
